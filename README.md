# Emotion Detection Project

This project implements an Emotion Detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify human emotions from grayscale facial images. The model is trained to recognize seven different emotions: **Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral**.

## Project Overview

The model is built using Keras with TensorFlow backend and includes several convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification. The dataset is preprocessed using Keras’ `ImageDataGenerator` to rescale pixel values and prepare training and validation data.

### Dataset

The project uses a dataset structured into **training** and **test** directories. Each directory contains subfolders named after the emotions being classified, holding the respective grayscale images. The dataset is loaded from a local path using Keras’ `flow_from_directory()` method.

### Model Architecture

The model follows a typical CNN architecture with:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from images using 32, 64, and 128 filters.
- **MaxPooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality while preserving important features.
- **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting with dropout rates of 25% and 50%.
- **Fully Connected Layer**: A dense layer with 1024 units, followed by a softmax output layer for classifying the seven emotions.

### Requirements

The project requires the following libraries:
- `opencv-python`
- `keras`
- `tensorflow`

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python keras tensorflow
```

### Model Training

The model is trained on the dataset over 50 epochs with a batch size of 64. The training and validation datasets are rescaled to have pixel values between 0 and 1.

The model is compiled with:
- **Loss function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam with a learning rate of 0.0001
- **Metrics**: Accuracy

### Code Example

```python
emotion_model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', 
                      optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.0001), 
                      metrics=['accuracy'])

emotion_model_info = emotion_model.fit_generator(
        train_generator,
        steps_per_epoch=28709 // 64,
        epochs=50,
        validation_data=validation_generator,
        validation_steps=7178 // 64)
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Ensure the dataset is in the correct directory format:
   ```
   - train/
     - Anger/
     - Disgust/
     - Fear/
     - Happy/
     - Sad/
     - Surprise/
     - Neutral/
   - test/
     (same structure as train)
   ```
3. Run the script to start training the model:
   ```bash
   python emotion_detection.py
   ```

### Results

The trained model achieves a reasonable level of accuracy across the seven emotional categories. Training and validation accuracy/loss graphs are plotted to evaluate performance over epochs.

### Future Work

- increase the model accuracy
- Fine-tune the model with additional datasets for improved accuracy.
